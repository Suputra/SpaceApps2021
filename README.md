# Mechanism Description with section views

![State 1](https://github.com/Suputra/SpaceApps2021/blob/main/Stage1.png)
State 1- The coil has current running through it generating a magnetic field that pushes the inner piston up (which itself is a strong permanent magnet), applying a force on the hydraulic fluid. This force is magnified onto the outer piston due to its larger area.

![State 2](https://github.com/Suputra/SpaceApps2021/blob/main/Stage%202.png)
State 2 (right after coil current switched) - Current to coil is turned off, magnetic field collapses and reverses for a very short time- allowing the inner piston to fly back. Then, magnetic field is switched again when piston passes midpoint, and inner piston is further pushed back, resulting in lower pressure in the hydraulic valve/chamber and release of the outer piston.

![State 3](https://github.com/Suputra/SpaceApps2021/blob/main/Stage%203.png)
State 3 (after coil current switched back) - as the pins retract, a torsion spring tensioning the latches is free to open the latch and release the device.
